## üìç Network & Demo Contract

This quickstart is configured to run on **Arbitrum Sepolia** testnet. A free demo NFT contract has been deployed specifically for this quickstart, allowing you to mint NFTs without any setup or deployment steps. The contract is pre-configured and ready to use out of the box.

## üöÄ Quick start

### Scaffold a new app

```bash
npm create next-app smart-wallets-quickstart -- --example https://github.com/alchemyplatform/smart-wallets-quickstart
cd smart-wallets-quickstart
```

### üîß Configure

Get your pre-configured API key and policy ID from the [Smart Wallets dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) by viewing one of your configurations. You will get a default app, configuration, and sponsorship policy created for you to quickly start testing.

Once you have your keys, add them to your `.env.local ` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local      # create if missing
# add NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=...
# add NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=...
```

| Variable                        | Purpose                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`   | API key for your Alchemy [app](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration)          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID` | Gas Manager policy ID for [sponsorship](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) |

If instead you want to set up your own configurations from scratch you should:

1. Create a new Alchemy [app](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps)
2. Set up a new Smart Wallet [configruation](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/smart-wallets/configuration) for your app to specify login methods
3. Create a gas sponsorship [policy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/services/gas-manager/configuration) for your app

Note: for production, you should [protect](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/resources/faqs#how-should-i-protect-my-api-key-and-policy-id-in-the-frontend) your API key and policy ID behind a server rather than exposing client side.

### Run your app!

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), first **Login**, then try minting a new NFT.

Congrats! You've created a new smart wallet and sent your first sponsored transaction!

## üóÇ Project layout

```
app/           # Next.js pages & components
components/ui/ # shadcn/ui primitives
lib/           # constants & helpers
config.ts      # Account Kit + Gas Sponsorship setup
tailwind.config.ts
```

## üèóÔ∏è How it works

1. `config.ts` initializes Account Kit with your API key, Arbitrum Sepolia chain, and Gas Sponsorship policy.
2. `Providers` wraps the app with `AlchemyAccountProvider` & React Query.
3. `LoginCard` opens the authentication modal (`useAuthModal`).
4. After login, `useSmartAccountClient` exposes the smart wallet.
5. `NftMintCard` uses `useSendUserOperation` to call `mintTo()` on the demo ERC‚Äë721, with gas paid by the Paymaster.
